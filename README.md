# Human-Activity-Recognition

## Description :
This project is made with a perspective of Recognising Human Activities. The human activity recognition model was trained on Kinetics 400 Dataset. To learn more about this dataset and model used refer Kay et al.’s 2017 paper, The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset. and Hara et al.’s 2018 CVPR paper, Can Spatiotemporal 3D CNNs Retrace the History of 2D CNNs and ImageNet? The authors Kensho Hara, Hirokatsu Kataoka, Yutaka Satoh have mentioned in their 2018 CVPR paper, how existing state-of-the-art 2D architectures (such as ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, etc.) can be extended to video classification via 3D kernels.
